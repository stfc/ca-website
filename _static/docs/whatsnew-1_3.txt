The major changes are as follows:

* Certificates are no longer public.  Actually the general
  public can still reach the interface, but they aren't
  listed to the public anymore (lists should still be
  available to RAs).

* Email address goes into the certificate.  This is the
  reason for no longer publishing certificates.

* New certificates.  Since the current CA is due to expire,
  we have issued new CA certificates.  The CA now becomes a
  subordinate, for various technical reasons, so you will
  often need to install also the root CA.  At least with
  Grid middleware.

* Robot certificates: these are a new type of "automated"
  user certificates, sort of a hybrid between user and hosts,
  in the sense that they can act as a user but have unprotected
  private keys.

  We do not expect to issue many of these, because users must
  instead hold the private key on a secure key token, and prove to
  you that the private key is thus protected.

* Object signing.  Users can now optionally have this in their
  certificate, but the CA does not check or assert that the user has
  any special qualifications to sign objects.

* CA's signing key goes online, protected by a FIPS 140-2 Level
  3 hardware signing module (HSM).  This is mainly to increase
  the signing turnaround for the issuing authority, and will not
  affect anyone else.

Note that not everything is implemented yet in the software.  We
will implement the remaining bits as we go along - we prefer to
test things as much as possible, rather than deploy all the features.
