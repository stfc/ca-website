Changed occurrences of CLRC to CCLRC (except in DNs of course).

Extensions compliance is now with RFC3280 instead of RFC2459.

Issuer DN was wrong.

Email verification clarified slightly (section 2.1.2 now refers to
3.1.9).  May still need more clarification but at the moment it seems
reasonable to put those in the Operator's procedure.

Split RA obligation into Manager's obligation and Operator's
obligation.

Speaking of email, we took out the bits about sending certificates to
subscribers by email because we are apparently not doing this at the
moment.  It will go back in later.

CNs clarified: the set of permissible characters is now well defined,
but for technical reasons it is rather smaller than what most people
would have liked.  These technical reasons are not OpenCA specific.
Some of the difficulties are due to software parsing the DN as a
string (so it will choke on spurious '/' or ',' characters, depending
on the way the DN is presented).  Other difficulties are more
fundamental, such how different software interprets and compares
T61Strings.  Some people have asked for UTF-8 in CNs but that is out
of the question: OpenSSL does not currently support UTF-8 so
certificates issued with UTF-8 would be useless.

**************************
Changes to extensions in personal and server/service certificates:

* basicConstraints and keyUsage will be both be marked critical;

* There will be a certificatePolicies extension with the
value policyIdentifier (OID);

* Host and service certs will get Fully Qualified Domain name in the
subjectAltName extension.

* Host and service certs will get nsCertType: SSL Server, SSL Client.
Previously they only had "SSL Server".
