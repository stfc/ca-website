Reissued root certificate with the following changes:

	1. Using SHA1 as hash algorithm instead of MD5

	2. Set keyUsage to critical (for historical reasons it wasn't)

The new root is downloadable from the usual location:
http://ca.grid-support.ac.uk/cgi-bin/sendcert

End entity certificates will also now use the SHA1 algorithm for signing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT NOTICE :

THE VALIDITY OF EXISTING END USER CERTIFICATE WILL NOT BE AFFECTED

Both new ones (with SHA1) and old ones (with MD5) will validate
successfully against both the old root (with MD5) and the new root
(with SHA1).

The signing policy does not change.  The name does not change.
------------------------------------------------------------------------

As of this version and in the future, the changelog version will not
be (and will not claim to be) a valid CP/CPS.  Thus all operations etc
are defined in a single document.

All other planned changes to the CP/CPS have been postponed till
version 1.2.

As this is a security issue, there is no consultation period.  The
CP/CPS takes effect immediately.
