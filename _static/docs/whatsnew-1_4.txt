Changed the organisation name - the host organisation was renamed from
"the Council for the Central Laboratory of the Research Council"
(CCLRC) to "Science and Technology Facilities Council" (STFC) when
CCLRC merged with the Particle Physics and Astronomy Research Council
(PPARC) in April 2007.

No other instance of "CCLRC" will change - the RAs named "CLRC" (the
original central laboratory run by the council for the laboratory)
will not change their names.

Changed the CA physical address slightly; in the above merger, the
recommended address changed very slightly.

Authority "name" finally removed from end entity authority key
identifier.  Also removed from CA certificate profile - this was a
bug, it was never in the CA certificate (nor should it have been).

CA issuer and subject changed following the security rollover in
November, with somewhat more sanitised names (discarding yet more
historical baggage - discarded the final L in the issuer name).  Also,
more informative CNs display better in browsers.


No other changes were implemented - a largeish number of changes are
pending but will be postponed to the next release (due January 2008).
