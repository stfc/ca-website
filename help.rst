Helpdesk
========

If you need to contact the UKCA Support Centre we require you to generate a helpdesk "ticket". Typically this will be to report some problem you are having with certificates.

Advice when submitting a ticket
###############################

In order for us to provide you with a prompt, accurate response please provide us with the following information (as appropriate) when logging a ticket:

* all steps/operations/instructions necessary to re-create or reproduce the problem;
* the data which causes the problem and the data which doesn't cause the problem if the problem is data dependent;
* the exact text (or a screenshot) of any error messages;
* version numbers and names of software involved, including the operating system and browser for certificate issues.
